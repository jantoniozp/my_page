            <p>I am Juan. I was born in Tijuana, Mexico but now I reside in Colorado, USA. I studied media, including TV, radio, newspaper, social media, etc.
                When I decided to study something different I went on to study software development for 6 months. 
                Due to unexpected circumstances I moved to the United States and started working on different restaurants until I became an assistant manager, job that I still keep and have been there for over 6 years.
                After realizing I had to come back to practice some of all those skills that I learned when I was younger started studying web development again and now I love working on small projects to keep on practicing my skills as a web and media developer while helping other people expand their audience.</p>
